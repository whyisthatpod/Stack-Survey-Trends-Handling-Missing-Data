# Stack-Survey-Trends-Handling-Missing-Data

Project Overview
You work for a staffing agency that specializes in finding qualified candidates for development roles. One of your latest clients is growing rapidly and wants to understand what kinds of developers they can hire, and to understand general trends of the technology market. Your organization has access to this Stack Overflow dataset, which consists of survey responses by developers all over the world for the last few years.

Your project is to put together several statistical analyses about the community to educate your client about the potential hiring market for their company.
